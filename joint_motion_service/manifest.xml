  <description brief="joint_motion_service">

     This joint_motion_service provides a self defined service, which can be called with a number of joint names and there target positions. It will forward those to the metralabs_ros node and check the current joint states. When they reach their target, the service call is replied successfully. Otherwise a timeout leads to a negative reply.
