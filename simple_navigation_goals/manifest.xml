  <description brief="simple_navigation_goals">

     This was made with the navigation tutorial SendingSimpleGoals and 
     demonstrates how to use the action lib let the navigation stack drive 
     to robot to a self chosen coordinate. 
     
     Has been pimped to do this repeatedly to patrol back and forth x times.
